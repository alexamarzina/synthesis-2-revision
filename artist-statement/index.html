 				<p>Even while attempting this project
 				the first time, it seemed out of my league.
 				Heck, even making a word cloud was difficult
 				for me. <b>BUT</b>, I did it. As previously
 				stated, this is a follow-up project of a
 				word cloud that I made from the same dataset,
 				and I wanted to further investigate the
 				usage of song titles.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>This graph is able to show the frequency
 				of the word "love" in song titles, for songs
 				written between 1930 and 2010 (or at least
 				the ones that are recorded in the dataset).
 				As you can see, love is a more recent topic
 				in the musical world, which is probably
 				contrary to what the world may think. Every
 				song seems to be about love some how, whether
 				it be about being in love, loving something
 				(an object), or even breaking up after once
 				being in love.</p>
 				<br>
 				</p>Making this through Plotly made it
 				interactive; you can hover on the line at
 				different years to see the year and the number
 				of "love songs" produced in that same year.
 				In order to do this, I had to take the data
 				out of the csv and put it into individual lists.
 				Then, through some Python fiddling, I was able to
 				"count" how many instances of love occurred
 				each year. Then, I just had to plug my variables
 				into Plotly and it did a lot of the magic for me.</p>
 				<br>.
 				<p>This may be cliche, but this project truly
 				did help me grow as a media student and a
 				person. Obviously, it enhanced my Python
 				(and various other coding) skills, as I was
 				able to produce a visualization that I couldn't
 				previously. It also helped my troubleshooting/debugging
 				skills, which needed some work and is most
 				of the "skill" required to code anything
 				successful. Because of these things, I've
 				also learned how to be more patient with
 				myself, something I've always struggled with.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>This viz could be useful for anyone else
 				who is a music fan and is interested in
 				studying the theme of love in music over the
 				years. Maybe a comparison could be made
 				between songs and something like movies,
 				which probably also have a large volume of
 				love in them.</p>
 				<br>
 				<p>To conclude, while love certainly isn't
 				a new theme or fad in music, it is definitely
 				increasing in popularity as time goes on;
 				according to the data, there is indeed an
 				increase over time of the number of new songs
 				that have the word "love" in the title.</p>
